## Dashdot – A Minimal Open Source Note-Taking App  
**Developed & Designed by Konstantinos Kadoglou**

---

### 🚧 Project Status

Dashdot is an experimental, personal project exploring architectural patterns in Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) development. The ultimate goal is to make it a fully functional cross-platform note-taking app.

Right now, it’s in active development. Expect frequent updates to the roadmap, architecture, and features. Along the way, I’ll share some UI/UX decisions, design guidelines, and maybe even some mockups.

### 💡 Tech Stack

- **Compose Multiplatform (CMP)**  
  Used for the UI across platforms. Android support is smooth, and while iOS isn’t as plug-and-play as APKs, it’s still supported.

- **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)**  
  A single codebase, written entirely in Kotlin, powering all platforms.

- **Firebase**  
  Chosen for now as the quickest way to get things up and running. You’re free to swap it out with your preferred backend/database. You can swap the firebase configs with your own files and use your firebase database.

### 🧭 Goals

- Build a clean, modular KMP architecture
- Ensure the app is easily extensible for contributors
- Provide design mockups and UX patterns as the UI evolves
- Deliver a smooth experience on Android and iOS.

### 🤝 Contributions

For now, this is more of a personal playground. But if you’re curious, feel free to watch the repo, open issues, or suggest ideas. Contributions may be welcome once the foundation is more stable.
